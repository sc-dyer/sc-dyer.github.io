<h1 id="launching_my_new_static_site">Launching my new static site</h1>
<p>After having spent too much money over the years on a Squarespace website that I hardly utilized, I decided it was time to simplify and downsize to a static website. Being a fan of the Julia programming language, I chose to use the Julia-based static site generator <a href="https://franklinjl.org/">Franklin.jl</a>. It has been a remarkably simple and enjoyable process, and while there are certainly many features I have not yet learned how to use, I am very pleased with the results.</p>
<p>Why did I decide to go static? I thought my previous website was very pretty. It opened to a page that cycled through several full page photos from field trips and field work that I have done during my schooling. The other pages on my site were nicely lain out with many high-res and beautiful photos of rocks, thin sections, or plots that I have made. It was certainly a nice site, but it was also a pain in the ass. Sure, the tools provided by Squarespace make it really easy to make pretty, nicely formatted layouts, but added a level of complexity that made it extremely annoying to edit after the fact. It also meant I had to make a special layout when accessing it from a phone, or just live with an ugly mobile site. This all compounded to a website that I did not enjoy working on &#40;and so I never did&#41; and was spending too much money on. Pretty pointless for a personal site to house my CV and information on my theses.</p>
<p>Over the years, as I have delved more into the world of tech, I have come to appreciate the simplicity of a simple static website. They are easy to use, easy to navigate, and easy to provide. I am hosting this site on GitHub and only pay &#36;20/year for the domain registration, and my site has pretty much all the same information it had on Squarespace. I found that building the site was straightforward and only required reading the docs and <em>some</em> technical know-how. Making modifications is quite easy as all the pages are written in Markdown and can be done directly in my text editor before deployment. The site is simple enough that I can dive into the HTML and CSS files and make modifications without too much fear despite knowing very little HTML or CSS. </p>
<p>This is all very enjoyable in ways that I never really imagined before, but after thinking about it, I do understand why. I think the fact that I am able to put this together myself and make modifications &#40;even simple ones&#41; to it to my liking all from my text editor provides a feeling of ownership that I never had with my previous site. If I want to make my site do something, I can actually figure out how to do it, so long as it&#39;s not anything too resource-intensive. If I want to move my site to another hosting service, I can do it very easily. I could even host it myself if I really wanted to.</p>
<p>This feeling of ownership that I have is relatable to how I feel about my bicycle compared to how I &#40;used to&#41; feel about my car. Before I sold it due to lack of use, I had a Honda Fit. It was a great car, very affordable and flexible, but it was still a car and so maintenance was never cheap or easy &#40;I am not a mechanic&#41;, modifications were purely accessory such as adding a roof rack or a rearview camera. I compare that to my bicycle, which is probably the inanimate object I am most attached to, and it&#39;s a very different relationship. Repairs are usually quite cheap, and often times I am able to do the repairs myself. Modifications are super straightforward and give me so much flexibility in how I want my bike to look and feel. I can change the handlebars, the saddle, the wheels, the tires, the fork, the pedals, even the frame if I am so inclined and none of these modifications are particularly <em>challenging</em> to do, and if I don&#39;t know how to do them they are usually very easy to learn, and if I don&#39;t have the tools, I can pop down to the local bike co-op to do use theirs. While my bike will never go as fast as my car did &#40;unless its on a train&#41;, it takes me to most places I need to go, and I am able to make it truly mine in ways that I never could with my car. I think this is similar to the static website, while it is not as powerful as my old website, it takes me where I need to go, and I am able to take ownership over it in ways I never could before.</p>
