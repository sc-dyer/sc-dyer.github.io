<h1 id="mulling_over_the_muskoka_domain_phd_series_part_1">Mulling over the Muskoka domain &#40;PhD series part 1&#41;</h1>
<p>This is the first part of a series of posts I intend to make that describe my PhD thesis and the work I have done for it over the past 4.5 years<sup id="fnref:1">[1]</sup>. In this first part I will be highlighting some of the questions that motivated my thesis and show off some interesting field observations.</p>
<h2 id="ancient_mountains_in_ontario">Ancient mountains in Ontario</h2>
<p>Readers that are familiar with the province of Ontario may be surprised to learn that almost a billion years ago, it was the heart of a mountain belt comparable to the Himalayas. The remnants of this mountain belt are found in the crystalline Canadian shield between Gravenhurst and Sudbury and studying these rocks inform us not only on how this ancient mountain belt formed, but also about the processes that are occurring in the depths of modern mountains belts all over the world. The part of this ancient mountain belt that I am particularly interested in is the Muskoka region. If you are from the Greater Toronto Area, you are familiar with this region as cottage country and you or someone you know likely owns a cottage in this area, or you have been camping there up in Algonquin Park. Geologically, this area is called the Muskoka domain, and it extends from Georgian Bay in the west and transitions into the related Opeongo domain to the east, which possibly extends all the way to the Ontario/Quebec border.</p>
<h2 id="a_mid-crustal_channel">A mid-crustal channel?</h2>
<p>It is the Muskoka and Opeongo domains that I am interested in because they represent an important and interesting mid-crustal structure in the ancient Grenville orogen. These units are made up largely of migmatites<sup id="fnref:2">[2]</sup> that have very high proportions of leucosome<sup id="fnref:3">[3]</sup> and contain a lot of coarse grained amphibole in both the leucosome and mesosome. These are two pieces of evidence that have been used to suggest that the migmatites were melted as a result of the addition of water</p>

        <td class="fndef-content">Rocks that were partially melted, composed of leucosome, which represents former melt, and mesosome, which represents the original unmelted rock.</td>

<h1 id="launching_my_new_static_site">Launching my new static site</h1>
<p>After having spent too much money over the years on a Squarespace website that I hardly utilized, I decided it was time to simplify and downsize to a static website. Being a fan of the Julia programming language, I chose to use the Julia-based static site generator <a href="https://franklinjl.org/">Franklin.jl</a>. It has been a remarkably simple and enjoyable process, and while there are certainly many features I have not yet learned how to use, I am very pleased with the results.</p>
<p>Why did I decide to go static? I thought my previous website was very pretty. It opened to a page that cycled through several full page photos from field trips and field work that I have done during my schooling and research. The other pages on my site were nicely lain out with many high-res and beautiful photos of rocks, thin sections, or landscapes that I have taken over the years. It was certainly a nice website, but it was also a pain in the ass. Sure, the tools provided by Squarespace make it really easy to make pretty, nicely formatted layouts, but it added a level of complexity that made it extremely annoying to edit. It also meant I had to make a special layout when accessing it from a phone, or just live with an ugly mobile site. This all compounded to a website that I did not enjoy working on and that I was spending too much money on. Pretty pointless for a personal site to house my CV and information on my theses.</p>
<p>Over the years, as I have delved more into the world of tech, I have come to appreciate the simplicity of a static website. They are easy to use, easy to navigate, and easy to provide. I am hosting this site on GitHub and only pay &#36;20/year for the domain registration, and my site has pretty much all the same information it had on Squarespace. I found that building the site was straightforward and only required reading the docs and <em>some</em> technical know-how. Making modifications is quite easy as all the pages are written in Markdown and can be done directly in my text editor before deployment. The site is simple enough that I can dive into the HTML and CSS files and make modifications without too much fear despite knowing very little HTML or CSS. </p>
<p>This is all very enjoyable in ways that I never really imagined before, but I think I understand why I like it so much more than my Squarespace site. The fact that I am able to put this together myself and modify it to my liking all from my text editor provides a feeling of ownership that I never had with my previous site. If I want to make my site do something, I can actually figure out how to do it, so long as it&#39;s not anything too resource-intensive. If I want to move my site to another hosting service, I can do it very easily. I could even host it myself if I really wanted to.</p>
<p>This is a relatable feeling that I have to my bicycle, especially in comparison to how I used to feel about my car before I sold it. I used to drive a Honda Fit, it was a great car, very affordable but had great utility, but at the end of the day it was still a car and so maintenance was never cheap or easy. Since I am no mechanic, modifications were purely accessory such as adding a roof rack or a rearview camera and personal repairs never went beyond changing the battery. When I compare that to my bicycle, it&#39;s a very different relationship. Repairs are usually quite cheap, and I am often able to do the repairs myself. Modifications are straightforward and give me so much flexibility in making my bike look and feel the way I want it to. I can change the handlebars, the saddle, the wheels, the tires, the fork, the pedals, even the frame if I am so inclined and none of these modifications are particularly <em>challenging</em> to do. If I don&#39;t know how to do the repairs, they are usually very easy to learn, and if I don&#39;t have the tools, I can pop down to the local bike co-op to use theirs. While my bike will never go as fast as my car did, it takes me to most places I need to go, and it is truly mine in ways that my car never was. I think this is similar to the static website, while it is not as powerful as my old website, it takes me where I need to go, and I am able to take ownership over it in ways I never could before.</p>
