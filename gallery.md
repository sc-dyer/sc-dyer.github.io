This page is a home for all of my nice and interesting photos. Many are geology related, but I also take photos for fun. Scroll through and let me know if there's any you particularly enjoy.

\figcap{A metapelite thin section under cross-polarised light. You can see the rainbow of white mica with a scattering of grey from quartz and plagioclase. The black round shapes are garnets and if you look closely you can see elongate grey kyanite as well. This was collected in the Atlin area during my MSc.}{}{A photo of a metapelite thin section under cross-polarized light}{100}{/assets/ts_42.jpg}
