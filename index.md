## About Me
I am a geologist by training, but geology is just one of my many interests. I also enjoy programming, particularly with the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/), GIS, and open-source technology. Recreationally, I enjoy biking, hiking, camping, and rock climbing.

Currently, I am a student at the University of Waterloo, pursuing a PhD in geology. I study metamorphic petrology under the supervision of [Prof. Chris Yakymchuk](https://uwaterloo.ca/earth-environmental-sciences/profile/cyakymch). My research is on fluid-fluxed melting in the Grenville Province and metamorphic reactions. This project has involved multiple field seasons in rural Ontario, as well as a variety of lab techniques and computational modelling. 

I completed my MSc at Carleton University under the supervision of [Prof. Fred Gaidies](https://www.teamgar.net/) in collaboration with the Geologic Survey of Canada (GSC). Information about my MSc thesis and the thesis itself are available here.

I received my Hon. BSc from the University of Toronto in 2018 with a specialist in geology and a minor in geographic information systems (GIS). During my undergraduate studies, I was involved in numerous research projects related to igneous petrology. These included studies on the Sudbury Igneous Complex and the Bushveld Igneous Complex.
