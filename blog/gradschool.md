# Let's Abolish Grad School
## Do happy PhD students exist?
I recently attended a conference (my last one ever as a grad student) and someone I met asked me for advice on applying to do a PhD. Half-jokingly I told them "Don't do a PhD." They said they already got that advice. I've been to quite a few conferences and met quite a few academics over my PhD and I don't think I have ever met a happy PhD student, except maybe the ones that are just starting. I've talked about this with people who are doing postdocs or working as professors now and pretty much everyone agrees that graduate school is miserable. 

[This](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03394-0) article probably provides a less biased perspective on the situation for graduate students across the globe. The data they present seems to suggest that happy PhD students *do* in fact exist, but a pretty large proportion of survey respondents (around 40%) are not satisfied with graduate school and more than half are getting or seeking help with anxiety or depression relating to their studies. While those numbers are *less* bleak than the complete lack of happy PhD students that I proposed, they are still pretty astounding and suggest that I am not just a jaded graduate student ready to be done with academia.

Still, I think it is quite depressing that I can find so many people that can acknowledge how bad the system is set up, yet there seems to be no real movement in making it better.
