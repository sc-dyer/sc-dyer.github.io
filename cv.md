# Skills & Interests

### GIS 
I took a GIS minor where I learned how to use a variety of tools in ArcGIS. I've used ArcGIS and QGIS to build maps for papers, posters, and presentations by incorporating a variety of data sources. I have done most of my field work with mobile GIS tools such as QField and ArcGIS Field Maps. I enjoy making and desigining useful and aesthetic geological maps using these tools

### Field Work & Mapping 
My field experience in my MSc and PhD were medium to large-scale regional studies that required targeted sampling. For my PhD, I was responsible for all logistics and planning of the field work. In my MSc, I worked with the GSC in remote northern BC, requiring multi-day fly camps in the mountains. My mapping skills have been developed primarily in field classes I have both taught and taken myself in multiple distinct geological regions in Ontario. I have a particular interest in field work and
mapping as part of large regional studies of high grade metamorphic terranes.

### Petrology & Geochemistry
Most of my work has been focused on determining metamorphic reactions and pressure-temperature-time paths using a combination of thermodynamic modelling and a variety of analytical techniques including petrography, SEM, EPMA, LA-ICP-MS, and XR-μCT to analyze textures, mineral geochemistry, and dates and determine the tectonic history of a region. I have also worked on migmatites, using these same techniques in addition to bulk rock geochemistry to assess regional melting processes and pathways. I am especially interested in studying petrology of igneous and metamorphic rocks with the aim of developing comprehensive tectonic models.

### Programming & Data Science
Throughout my MSc and PhD I have developed programs for modelling, data analysis, and data visualization using Python and Julia. This has required the application of tools like MatPlotLib, Makie.jl, and data frames, as well as statistical methods like K-means clustering, linear and nonlinear regressions, and principal component analysis. I enjoy working with large data sets and developing tools to interpret and visualize that data.
