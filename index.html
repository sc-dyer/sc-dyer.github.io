I also enjoy programming, particularly with the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia language</a>, GIS, and open-source technology. Recreationally, I enjoy biking, hiking, camping, and rock climbing.</p> <p>Currently, I am a student at the University of Waterloo, pursuing a PhD in geology. I study metamorphic petrology under the supervision of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/earth-environmental-sciences/profile/cyakymch">Prof. Chris Yakymchuk</a>. My research is on fluid-fluxed melting in the Grenville Province and metamorphic reactions. This project has involved multiple field seasons in rural Ontario, as well as a variety of lab techniques and computational modelling. </p> <p>I completed my MSc at Carleton University under the supervision of <a href="https://www.teamgar.net/">Prof. Fred Gaidies</a> in collaboration with the Geologic Survey of Canada &#40;GSC&#41;. Information about my MSc thesis and the thesis itself are available here.</p> <p>I received my Hon. BSc from the University of Toronto in 2018 with a specialist in geology and a minor in geographic information systems &#40;GIS&#41;. During my undergraduate studies, I was involved in numerous research projects related to igneous petrology. These included studies on the Sudbury Igneous Complex and the Bushveld Igneous Complex.</p> <p>To see some of the software projects I have worked on, check out my <a href="https://github.com/sc-dyer">GitHub</a>.</p> <div class=page-foot > <a href=" https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/ ">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a> Sabastien Dyer.
